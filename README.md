# HLA-B27_Peptide_Molecular_Mimicry_MD_Analysis
MD simulations of  human protein HLA-B27:05 (PDB 5txs) to some peptide sequences associated with host protein Annexine and Gut Microbiota (Klebsiella pneumoniae) to identify microbe derived peptides that mimic host peptides in binding behavior to providing insights into molecular mimicry in autoimmune disease such as Ankylosing spondylitis.
